# Command-Line Calculator

## Overview

Welcome to the **Command-Line Calculator**! This script is designed to provide a versatile set of calculation tools right from your terminal. Whether you need to perform basic arithmetic, compare values, or check membership in sequences, this calculator has you covered. The script features a user-friendly, menu-driven interface that walks you through various operations.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division (both Float and Floor), Modulus, and Exponential calculations.
- **Relational Operations:** Evaluate Greater Than, Less Than, Equal To, Not Equal To, Greater Than or Equal To, and Less Than or Equal To comparisons.
- **Logical Operations:** Apply logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT to your inputs.
- **Bitwise Operations:** Execute Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Right Shift, and Left Shift operations.
- **Assignment Operations:** Use Assignment, Addition Assignment, Subtraction Assignment, Multiplication Assignment, and Division Assignment to manage and modify values.
- **Identity Operations:** Check object identities with `is` and `is not` operators.
- **Membership Operations:** Verify presence in sequences using `in` and `not in` operators.

## How to Use

1. **Starting the Script:**
   - Launch the script using Python. You'll be prompted with an option to enter `'start'` to begin or `'exit'` to quit.

2. **Choosing an Operation:**
   - After starting, select the type of operation you want to perform from the menu:
     - **1. Arithmetic Operator**
     - **2. Relational Operator**
     - **3. Logical Operator**
     - **4. Bitwise Operator**
     - **5. Assignment Operator**
     - **6. Identity Operator**
     - **7. Membership Operator**

3. **Performing Calculations:**
   - Follow the prompts to select specific operations and provide the necessary input values. Each category offers a set of operations and instructions to guide you through the process.

4. **Example:**
   - **Arithmetic Operations:**
     ```plaintext
     Enter 'start' to begin and 'exit' to quit
     Enter the choice (start/exit): start

     Select the operation you want to perform in the calculator:
     1. Arithmetic operator
     2. Relational operator
     3. Logical operator
     4. Bitwise operator
     5. Assignment operator
     6. Identity operator
     7. Membership operator

     Enter the choice (1-7): 1

     In arithmetic operator what do you want to perform?
     1. Addition
     2. Subtraction
     3. Multiplication
     4. Division
     5. Modulus
     6. Exponential

     Enter the choice: 1
     Enter the first number: 5
     Enter the second number: 3
     Addition is 8
     ```

5. **Exiting the Program:**
   - To exit at any time, simply type `'exit'` when prompted.
